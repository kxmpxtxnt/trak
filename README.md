# Trak

Trak (hipper version of 'track') is an opensource multiplatform app which helps (Soon™) to track food, sports, and even
your period.

Furthermore, there should be the possibility to do this tracking with your friends to push each other.

## Motivation

I've never really had a connection to full stack. That's about to change, and I also want to try using all kinds of
business software stuff to gain experience.
Plus, I hate paying for apps, which includes period trackers (which I don't need) and nutrition trackers.
